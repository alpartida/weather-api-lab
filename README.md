# Weather App

This Weather App project I made during my time at Redwood Code Academy. I didn't know I'd end up making more Weather Apps after I made this one, since SheCodes also had me create Weather Apps, one using Javascript and the other React. 

This project in particular was my first Weather App. I used the Weather Api to gather live data. https://openweathermap.org/api
