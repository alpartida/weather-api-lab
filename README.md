# Weather App

This Weather App project I made during my time at Redwood Code Academy. I didn't know I'd end up making more Weather Apps after I made this one, since SheCodes also had me create Weather Apps, one using Javascript and the other React. 

This project in particular was my first Weather App. I used the Weather Api to gather live data. https://openweathermap.org/api

## npm install
Installs the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

## npm run start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
